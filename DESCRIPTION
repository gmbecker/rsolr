Title: R to Solr interface
Version: 0.0.0
Author: Michael Lawrence, Jan Vogel

Description: An R API for querying Apache Solr databases.  Each Solr
             core is represented by an object with an interface
             resembling that of a data frame. Queries are processed
             lazily, i.e., a query is only sent to the database when
             the data are required; otherwise, only the query is
             updated. Query results are cached.
